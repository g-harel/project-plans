## Why

## Usage

The dice has two identical, but 180deg rotated faces, with one exception. On one side of the dice the very center is blank, and on the other there is a little "+" symbol. The side with the symbol is the _lucky side_.

Flipping a coin (d2) is the most straightforward, use the lucky side symbol to map to a yes/no or heads/tails.

Start any higher _roll_ by spinning the coin on a flat surface like a top. Then, when it feels right, stop it with a confident stomp from your favorite finger. The first entirely visible number from the appropriate _ring_ is what you've rolled. When you're rolling a d8, d12 or d20 add the lucky bonus (+4, +6, +10 respectively). If you land on the lucky side for other dice denominations, give yourself a pat on the back and don't add any bonus.
