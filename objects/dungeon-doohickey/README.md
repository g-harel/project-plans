  Dungeon Doohickey
  <br>
  <sup><sub><sup>7-in-1 D&D dice coin.<sup></sub>
</h1>

## Why

Dice are bulky and can't disappear in a pocket, apps are boring. Coins are cool, and meant to be carried around. Admittedly the dungeon doohickey is not as convenient to use as other options and is the wrong choice for intense rolling sessions. But in a pinch it can be of great use to gamble or pick the next stop on your euro trip.

_Note that the material used to create the coin wil also affect its usability. I made the mistake of having it be a 6mm thick disk of metal and both the sound and heft made it unusable in most circumstances and on most (delicate) surfaces_

## How

The dice has two identical, but 180deg rotated faces, with one exception. On one side of the dice the very center is blank, and on the other there is a little "+" symbol. The side with the symbol is the _lucky side_.

Flipping a coin (d2) is the most straightforward, use the lucky side symbol to map to a yes/no or heads/tails.

Start any higher _roll_ by spinning the coin on a flat surface like a top. Then, when it feels right, stop it with a confident stomp from your favorite finger. The first entirely visible number from the appropriate _ring_ is what you've rolled. When you're rolling a d8, d12 or d20 add the lucky bonus (+4, +6, +10 respectively). If you land on the lucky side for other dice denominations, give yourself a pat on the back and don't add any bonus.
