From the back of the cabinet frame, trace the shape of the face frame opening onto the template material. Marking multiple times ensures a more accurate template and reduces the chance of the pencil's thickness offsetting the line. Label the template side that is being marked with \"INSIDE\". Using a saw follow the outside of the line, cutting out the template as precisely as possible. Refine the shape to a more precise match with some sanding. ","Select a piece of veneered plywood that is larger than the pattern and whose grain should be visible in the finished piece. Mark the selected area as \"OUTSIDE\". Temporarily place the pattern onto the veneered plywood making sure that the \"INSIDE\" face of the template is facing the \"OUTSIDE\" face of the panel. Trace the pattern onto the plywood, then cut it out roughly with a saw. Use double-stick tape to solidly reattach the template to the veneered plywood panel. Using a 1/8\" rabbeting router bit, run the bit's bearing against the template without cutting into the template. Detach the template then use a flush trim router bit to remove the remaining material.
