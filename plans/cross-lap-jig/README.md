  Cross-Lap Router Jig
  <br>
  <sup><sub><sup>Router jig for <a href="../../furniture/tic-tac-toilet">tic-tac-toilet</a> joinery<sup></sub>
</h1>

This jig was designed to be 3D printed with parameters adjusted for material
thickness and width. It can be used for all the joinery, but requires finishing
work with a chisel to square up the dados.
