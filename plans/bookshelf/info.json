        "Clamp a piece of template material to the face frame so that it covers the entire cabinet door opening. From the back of the cabinet frame, trace the shape of the face frame opening onto the template material. Marking multiple times ensures a more accurate template and reduces the chance of the pencil's thickness offsetting the line. Label the template side that is being marked with \"INSIDE\"",
        "Using a saw capable of cutting curves (ex. jigsaw, bandsaw) follow the outside of the line, cutting out the template as precisely as possible. Refine the shape to a more precise match with some sanding. Select a veneered plywood section that is larger than the pattern. Temporarily place the pattern onto the veneered plywood making sure that the \"INSIDE\" face of the template is facing the part of the panel that should be visible in the finished piece. Mark the pattern onto the plywood, then cut it out roughly with the same saw as earlier. Use double-stick tape to reattach the template to the veneered plywood panel. Using a 1/8\" rabbeting router bit, run the bit's bearing against the template without cutting into the template. Use a flush trim router bit to remove the remaining material.",

Use a jigsaw and some sanding blocks to cut out the half-circle 1/4\" _outside_ the line and adjust the fit in the bookshelf rabbet. Once acceptable, mark where the half-circle lands in the middle of the thickness of the first shelf and cut that line with a saw",
        "Measure the panel width from rabbet to rabbet and cross cut the remaining 1/4\" panels to that width. With the bookshelf facing down, place the previously cut half-circle where it will be attached and measure from its bottom edge to the middle of the next shelf. Subtract 1mm and rip the a panel to that dimension. Place on the bookshelf and repeat for all shelves.",
        "Mark the back of the panels and their orientation. Remove the panels, flip them over and apply the selected wallpaper. Depending on the width of the wallpaper it can take up to 4500mm of material to cover all the panels, less if the cabinet panel is excluded or the wallpaper is wide enough to be used for more than one panel. Place the panels back on the back of the bookshelf and use a pin nailer or stapler to semi-permanently attach it to the frame."
