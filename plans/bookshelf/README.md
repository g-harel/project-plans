## Steps

### 1. Cutlist

### 2. Bending Jig

### 3. Arch

### 4. Face Frame

### 5. Frame

### 6. Doors

### 7. Panels

Use the bending jig from earlier to trace out a half circle onto the 1/4" material. Use a jigsaw and some sanding blocks to cut out the half-circle 1/4" _outside_ the line and adjust the fit in the bookshelf rabbet. Once acceptable, mark where the half-circle lands in the middle of the thickness of the first shelf and cut that line with a saw

Measure the panel width from rabbet to rabbet and cross cut the remaining 1/4" panels to that width. With the bookshelf facing down, place the previously cut half-circle where it will be attached and measure from its bottom edge to the middle of the next shelf. Subtract 1mm and rip the a panel to that dimension. Place on the bookshelf and repeat for all shelves.

Mark the back of the panels and their orientation. Remove the panels, flip them over and apply the selected wallpaper. Depending on the width of the wallpaper it can take up to 4500mm of material to cover all the panels, less if the cabinet panel is excluded or the wallpaper is wide enough to be used for more than one panel. Place the panels back on the back of the bookshelf and use a pin nailer or stapler to semi-permanently attach it to the frame.
