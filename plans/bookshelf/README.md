## Steps

### 1. Cutlist

### 2. Bending Jig

### 3. Arch

### 4. Face Frame

### 5. Frame

### 6. Doors

Clamp a piece of template material to the face frame so that it covers the
opening of both cabinet doors. From the back of the cabinet frame, trace the
shape of the face frame opening onto the template material. Marking multiple
times ensures a more accurate template and reduces the chance of the pencil's
thickness offsetting the line. Label the template side that is being marked with
"INSIDE". Using a saw follow the outside of the line, cutting out the template
as precisely as possible. Refine the shape to a more precise match with some
sanding.

Select a piece of veneered plywood that is larger than the pattern and whose
grain should be visible in the finished piece. Mark the selected area as
"OUTSIDE". Temporarily place the pattern onto the veneered plywood making sure
that the "INSIDE" face of the template is facing the "OUTSIDE" face of the
panel. Trace the pattern onto the plywood, then cut it out roughly with a saw.
Use double-stick tape to solidly reattach the template to the veneered plywood
panel. Using a 1/8" rabbeting router bit, run the bit's bearing against the
template without cutting into the template. Detach the template then use a flush
trim router bit to remove the remaining material. Verify the fit of the panel in
the frame and adjust with sanding as needed for an even reveal all around.

Mark the center of the panel, then mark a line perpendicular from the bottom
which intersects with that center mark. Using a saw, make a cut centered on that
line. The most common saw kerfs will remove roughly the right amount of material
from both panels to maintain the 1/8" reveal between the panels, but if you used
a different size of rabbeting bit or have a smaller kerf width, cut the
appropriate amount off both sides. First apply edge banding to the fresh
vertical cut, then to the continuous top-side-bottom face.

Apply finish, then measure and cut for hardware as specified by the
manufacturer. Take care in ensuring the orientation of the panel is as intended
and consistent with the now-erased "OUTSIDE" mark.

### 7. Panels

Use the bending jig from earlier to trace out a half circle onto the 1/4"
material. Use a jigsaw and some sanding blocks to cut out the half-circle 1/4"
_outside_ the line and adjust the fit in the bookshelf rabbet. Once acceptable,
mark where the half-circle lands in the middle of the thickness of the first
shelf and cut that line with a saw

Measure the panel width from rabbet to rabbet and cross cut the remaining 1/4"
panels to that width. With the bookshelf facing down, place the previously cut
half-circle where it will be attached and measure from its bottom edge to the
middle of the next shelf. Subtract 1mm and rip the a panel to that dimension.
Place on the bookshelf and repeat for all shelves.

Mark the back of the panels and their orientation. Remove the panels, flip them
over and apply the selected wallpaper. Depending on the width of the wallpaper
it can take up to 4500mm of material to cover all the panels, less if the
cabinet panel is excluded or the wallpaper is wide enough to be used for more
than one panel. Place the panels back on the back of the bookshelf and use a pin
nailer or stapler to semi-permanently attach it to the frame.
