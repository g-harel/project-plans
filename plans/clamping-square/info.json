      "This clamping square was created as a lower cost alternative to the [Woodpeckers clamping squares + CSP clamps](https://www.woodpeck.com/clamping-squares-plus.html) and their multiple clones. The design comes with some tradeoffs:",
      "- Can only be used/clamped on the inside of a joint and therefore cannot be used to line up butt joints.",
      "- Both the square and the clamps are bulkier and harder to manipulate.",
      "- Lower precision. Initially it is entirely dependent on the squareness of cut, but wood is more likely to change over time than aluminum.",
      "- Squeeze-out may bond to the surface of the square if some countermeasures are not added (like packing tape)."
