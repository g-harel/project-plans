  Clamping Square
  <br>
  <sup><sub><sup>90Â° clamping aides for Bessey TK-6 clamps.<sup></sub>
</h1>

This clamping square was created as a lower cost alternative to the [Woodpeckers clamping squares + CSP clamps](https://www.woodpeck.com/clamping-squares-plus.html) and their multiple clones. The design comes with some tradeoffs:

- Can only be used/clamped on the inside of a joint and therefore cannot be used to line up butt joints.
- Both the square and the clamps are bulkier and harder to manipulate.
- Lower precision. Initially it is entirely dependent on the squareness of cut, but wood is more likely to change over time than aluminum.
- Squeeze-out may bond to the surface of the square if some countermeasures are not added (like packing tape).
